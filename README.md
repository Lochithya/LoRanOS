# LoRanOS - Hardware Information Display Operating System

LoRanOS is a simple, custom-built 16-bit operating system kernel written in Assembly language. It is designed specifically to **query and display hardware-level information** in a
virtualized environment using **Oracle VirtualBox**, **Ubuntu Linux**, and **NASM** (Netwide Assembler). Inspired by low-level system programming and OS development projects like 
MikeOS , LoRanOS demonstrates direct interaction with system hardware using BIOS interrupts and CPU instruction sets.

## üéØ Objective

The goal of LoRanOS is to **retrieve and display detailed hardware information** of a virtualized x86 machine environment. This project showcases key concepts of OS kernel development, 
BIOS-level programming, and CPU feature querying.

### üÜö Dual Boot vs Virtual Machine: Which One for LoRanOS?

| Feature/Aspect              | Dual Boot                             | Virtual Machine (Oracle VM)             |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **System Reboot Required** |  Yes (every switch)                    |  No (runs inside host OS)              |
| **Setup Complexity**       |  High (partitioning, bootloader)       |  Easy (VM creation is straightforward) |
| **Testing Speed**          |  Slow (full reboot needed)             |  Fast (instant reloads)                |
| **Hardware Access**        |  Direct/native                         |  Virtualized (good for most use cases) |
| **Risk of Data Loss**      |  High (modifying boot configs)         |  Very low                              |
| **Snapshot/Backup Support**|  No                                    |  Yes (easy to save/restore states)     |
| **Performance**            |  Native performance                    |  Slightly lower due to virtualization  |
| **Recommended For**        | Advanced users, final deployment       | Development, learning, experimentation  |


Keep on enjoying the OS , Good Luck !
